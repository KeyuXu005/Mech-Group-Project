# Mech-Group-Project

The codes for motor control and MPU6050 sensor are combined in one file.

The code for motor encoder was based on this public repository https://github.com/curiores/ArduinoTutorials.git
The codes for stablising the DC motor at the start and PID tunning parameters were written and found by myself. I also add the code to print the voltage variation.

MPU6050 sensor code was created with the assistance of Adafruit sensor library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPU6050.git
